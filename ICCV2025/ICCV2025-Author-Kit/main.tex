% \usepackage{iccv}              % To produce the CAMERA-READY version
\usepackage[review]{iccv}      % To produce the REVIEW version

\input{preamble}

% It is strongly recommended to use hyperref, especially for the review version.
% hyperref with option pagebackref eases the reviewers' job.
% Please disable hyperref *only* if you encounter grave issues, 
% e.g. with the file validation for the camera-ready version.
%
% If you comment hyperref and then uncomment it, you should delete *.aux before re-running LaTeX.
% (Or just hit 'q' on the first LaTeX run, let it finish, and you should be clear).
